# Structure Programming 2 — CA1 (Year 1)

## Overview

This repo contains the CA1 (Continuous Assessment 1) project for the *Structure Programming 2* course in Year 1. It includes solutions in Python along with documentation files describing the requirements and design. The project appears to focus on building a **spell-checker** component.

## Contents

* `MykhailoHnylytskyi.py` — Main Python implementation.
* `Assess#1GroupX.docx` — Assessment specification / prompt document for the group.
* `PythonSpellChecker.docx` — Design / documentation related to the spell-checker.

## Functionality

The program implements a spell checker that likely:

* parses input text,
* checks words against a dictionary,
* detects misspellings,
* possibly suggests corrections.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed (version X.Y or above).
2. Run the script by:

   ```bash
   python MykhailoHnylytskyi.py <input_file>  
   ```

   or however the program is invoked (you may need to adapt depending on parameters).
3. See documentation (`PythonSpellChecker.docx`) for more detail on how to prepare input, what output is expected, etc.

## Dependencies

* Pure Python (no external packages required) — or list any packages used.
* Uses a dictionary file (if provided or required).

## Project Goals & Learning Outcomes

* To practice structured programming paradigms (functions, modularisation).
* To develop file I/O handling in Python.
* To implement algorithms for string matching / comparison.
* To write documentation and specification documents.
